                <p>Welcome to the Great Revel. I'm Bosseidon, a dude that plays Magic: The Gathering. I'm particularly fond of the Modern format, with Burn being my deck of choice. I like it so much that I decided to create all of this content as an outlet for my thoughts about it.</p>
                <p>I have a podcast, also entitled "The Great Revel", which is uploaded to my Youtube channel. I know Youtube is not the best place to have it on, but setting it up with other services ain't free, and pretty cardboard costs money. I also stream semi-regularly on Twitch, which really means like once or twice a week depending if I'm too busy with work and/or college.</p>
                <p>There's also a Discord for Red based aggro decks, with channels for every format, which I'm a part of, and am quite active there. Feel free to join if these strategies interest you, or if you have any questions you want answering.</p>

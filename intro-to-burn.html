                <p>If you're looking to get started with Burn in Modern, then this is the page for you! I will try to go over the basics of the deck, and over every card the deck classically plays.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">"Isn't Burn just a cheap and easy intro deck?"</h2>
                <p>Short answer: no. One of the biggest misconceptions about this deck is that it's super easy to play, and that it's a good choice to lend to a friend that's new to the game. That simply isn't true. While Burn has quite a simple plan, a very linear one to boot, give it to someone that's fresh off the boat and they're guaranteed to have a bad time. Modern just isn't a format for beginners. It's a cutthroat one where mistakes are measured in miles, and Burn is a deck that wins by inches. One wrong decision in the many that the deck presents will lose you games.</p>
                <p>Having said that, general modern knowledge and a bit of understanding in what makes this deck tick goes a long way in making it a very quick pick up. Mastering it (something which I wouldn't even say I've done) is another story, and requires you to be able to look at the game in a more mathematical way. But we'll talk about that some other time. This page will cover the basics, the "what makes the deck tick" I mentioned earlier.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">What is Burn all about?</h2>
                <p>Simply speaking, Burn is all about direct damage, i.e., cards that can directly damage opponents. Key word here being "can", as we do like our spells to be able to hit creatures (and planeswalkers) if needed. Effectively, we want variations of
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>Lightning Bolt.</a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-bolt.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                Because there are enough cards that do this (as you'll see in the next section), you are able to build a deck mostly out of cards that deal 3 damage for 1 mana. That means you are looking to resolve 7 spells, each costing 1 mana, to win games. That averages a turn 4 kill, which on its own isn't super fast, but interacting directly with spells isn't something most decks can do, which means that that kill is going to inveitably happen unless your opponent can do something about it. This "inevitability" is a key aspect of the deck, because it pushes opponents to either get their plan going asap, or they just lose the game. We add to that that a lot of our spells deal damage to any target, meaning we can effectively stop most early threats without slowing down our own kill (you can still win by turn 4 even if you have to use some spells on the board). And as a nice plus, we still add to all that that modern has enough fetchlands to enable turn 3 wins (if our opponent takes 2 damage to their own lands, we now only need to resolve 6 spells to win). This is the basis of our deck. Inevitability in its win, stemming from a deck built by a critical mass of burn spells.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, we don't actually have ~40 copies of Lightning Bolt effects in the format, and as such, we need to play some other cards. But it's not all bad. Some of those cards can deal 4 damage instead of 3, and that effectively pushes the number of spells we have to resolve to win the game from 7 to 6 (if we cast 2 of them, for example). This is great. It means we need 1 less non-land card drawn, which is great at combating one of Burn's biggest issues: drawing too many lands. Because of that, these cards represent card advantage for us. It can be weird to think about card advantage being something as simple as "this card deals 1 extra damage", but that's exactly what it is for us. Another form of card advantage in Burn, which typically isn't considered as such by other decks, are creatures, because they can hit for more than 3 damage while they are alive. Of course, playing creatures leaves us vulnerable to removal. As stated before, Burn is a deck against which removal does very little against, and making our opponents have dead cards is key for us to overwhelm them. Thus playing said creatures is a risk, as having them hit with removal before they hit the opponent will represent card disadvantage for us (well, card equity if you want to be a real stickler about it, but the conclusion is the same: the game goes longer). To reduce this risk, our creatures REALLY need to be able to affect the opponents' life on the turn they are played, to minimize how good removal is against us, and keep our resistance to removal as an upside.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">What cards does Burn play?</h2>
                <p>In this section I'm gonna go over the mainboard cards that Burn plays. At least the core, established ones. Alternative or more "avant-garde" ones will be covered some other time.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Fixed slots:</h3>
                <p>These are the cards that consistently perform well in the deck, and for the foreseeable future shouldn't be less than 4 in your deck.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Lightning Bolt:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-bolt.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        the best card of the deck, and most likely one of the best cards ever created design-wise. As I've said before, our whole deck is built around effects like this, and this one unconditionally costing 1 mana and being an Instant. Can't get much better than that.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Lava Spike:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lava-spike.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        it always costs 1 mana (which we will sadly soon see is not a given), but as a Sorcery that's only able to hit the opponent (or their planeswalkers, which can be relevant), it's really only playable in our deck. Having said that, we love it, even if it can't be used to control the board.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Skewer the Critics:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/skewer-the-critics.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        the first of our "conditional bolts", as they're commonly reffered as. Enabling spectacle on command is actually not trivial, which can makes this card a bit of a liability in some hands. Its biggest downside is that it isn't a turn 1 play, which is something we can't afford in most of our cards. Still, with this one very frequently costing 1 mana, we just can't pass it up.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Rift Bolt:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/rift-bolt.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        our other "conditional bolt", this one playable on turn 1. Much worse when draw later, and can be responsible for losses when it is drawn as your last required spell. But that is made up by the fact that it is essentially inconditional in every other turn, which makes it strong enough to earn a permanent slot in our deck.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Goblin Guide:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/goblin-guide.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        our best creature. Some people underestimate it because they read it and think it'll draw their opponents a ton of cards, including helping them curve out their mana, but that's not how the card works. Because Goblin Guide draws lands on reveal, a land which they would've drawn either way, it actually helps your opponents find non-land spells. That means that, barring a deck with an unusually high number of lands, it will just give you info about your opponents hand around 60% percent of the time. That's a pretty good deal, specially when you add to that that Burn's games are fast, and 1 or 2 extra cards are unlikely to affect the game too much. Because of this, I don't read Goblin Guide with a liability, but with a strength. I don't think that I then have to explain why a hasty 2/2 for R is a good card to be playing, but I will anyway. It has haste and it deals damage in multiples of 2. If it hits twice, which isn't a lot given it costs 1 mana and can come down on turn 1, will immediately represent card advantage. Any more hits are just icing on the cake.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Monastery Swiftspear:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        our other hasty 1 drop, this one is slightly worse. Prowess triggers from most of our deck, so it's going to be hitting for at least 2 every turn past the first one, and it doesn't have that risky effect of drawing cards for our opponent, but it often only starts representing card advantage on its third hit (hits for 1 on turn 1 and most often for 2 on turn 2, which is 3 damage for 1 red mana, and needs to hit a third time to represent 4+ damage on 1 card), which is a big downgrade from Goblin Guide's second hit. Still, it will easily be 3 damage for 1 mana, and at 2 toughness that can grow and attack throug a lot of boards, it's a strong card. It can also represent up to 5 damage between turns 2 and 3 with very aggressive draws, which will be a valuable enabler of turn 3 kills.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Boros Charm:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/boros-charm.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        pretty much the whole reason we play the White alongside the Red. It dealing 4 damage is the cleanest form of card advantage we could ask for, and being an Instant just makes it too good. Its other modes can also be relevant, with the double strike having numerous combat trick applications, and the indestructible mode can really punish decks that don't play much removal and are trying to clear the board to survive. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is the list of cards I consider "fixed slots". There are other cards that people will commonly consider fixed, but they are all cards that can be made useless by meta shifts. These are the "flexible slots", which simply means that they are cards that are played to attack the current meta</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Flexible slots:</h3>
                <p>These cards are more meta dependent than the previous ones, even though some of them have been played for a long time. This simply means that given a specific meta, they can be too much of a liability to be playing, and should be cut (either from the mainboard or altogether from the deck, again, depending on the meta).</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Searing Blaze:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/searing-blaze.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        there's quite a bit to say about this card. It's probably our best flex slot, as its ceiling is essentially casting 2 Lightning Bolts. It's very unlikely that a meta is without creatures for us to target, which makes its a 2 mana Lightning Bolt. Still, a lot of people overestimate this card just because at first it looks like it is always a 2 for 1. But it isn't. Using it to kill a random 1/1 keywordless creature isn't actually a form of card advantage. We don't need to kill that creature (sure sure, sometimes killing a 1/1 is the difference between a win and a loss, but we're discussing typical situations here), so in this situation Searing Blaze is really just a fancy 2 mana Lightning Bolt. Another thing about this card is that, even though its ceiling is so incredibly strong, it's actually not very common to enable landfall twice on command. That means that even in metas filled with key creatures we want to kill, it's a big risk to be playing more than 3 of these, so I would not reccommend it.

                                Eidolon of the Great Revel:

                        easily one of my top 5 cards of all time, I love it. It has a very powerful static effect, which can win a lot of games on its own, but it comes with a huge downside: it's symmetric. And because of how our deck is built, it will trigger with EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR SPELLS. That's huge. Play one without being careful about it and it can very easily be your downfall. This balance between it being very good and very bad for us depending on how/when you play it makes it one of the funnest and most rewarding cards to play. Its secret is that its symmetry is broken in 2 ways. First, it's a 2/2 creature, and as such, each attack helps it dealing more damage to them than it deals to us. Second, it deals 2 to us for every spell we cast, but our spells are going to be dealing 3/4 damage, which means we are still dealing more damage than we receive. By breaking its symmetry, we can push its effect into being a strength, and understanding this is the key to being able to play the card with success. Notably, this card doesn't have haste, but because it will still deal 2 damage when faced with removal, it's still technically affecting our opponent's lifetotal as soon as it comes down, and checks that mark for us.

                        a necessary evil when other decks play mainboard lifegain, simply because its floor is a 2 mana Lava Spike (not awful when you need to cover the lifegain weakness in the starting 60). I hate playing this card, because not only is it as slow as my grandpa, it also means there's enough lifegain being played that I need it. It can be hard to play a successful Skullcrack, as sometimes you have to correctly read that your opponent is going to try and gain life in the upcoming turn.

                        the best 2 mana Ligtning Bolt that is available, since we are already playing the W splash. It has the same flexibility as Lightning Bolt, but the lifegain also helps in getting the upper hand against other aggro decks. It's pretty much a filler card you play when you need some more non-land cards and don't have the need or the space for the other cards in this list.

                        </span>
                        a newer addition, but a very interesting one, in my opinion. As I've said many times before, a spell dealing 4 damage is a big deal, and playing Boros Charm is most of the reason why we play Boros instead of Mono Red. So it would make sense that adding more of this effect would be desirable, but the fact that it's symmetric makes it hard to want to include in high numbers and/or alongside Eidolon of The Great Revel, which is another source of self damage. I think it's a great filler card for when Eidolon is not particularly well positioned, and/or when Lightning Helix is filling up 4 slots in your deck.

                <h3 class="subtitle">Mana Base:</h3>
                <p>Finally, the lands. We play a varied mana base, where some key lands are very important for the deck's success. The most important thing is: ALL OUR LANDS NEED TO TAP FOR RED. It's easy to think a single non red land is fine, but what you're doing is you're effectively lowering the land count. Barely any of your spells don't cost R, and we have enough spells that cost RR.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Mountain:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/mountain.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        gotta have baics, and as I said earlier, all of ours need to tap for R.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Inspiring Vantage:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/inspiring-vantage.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        our first 3 turns are the most important ones, and the 4th one is often not needed (as we can already double spell on 3 mana). So this land as very little downside, while it fixes our mana for no life cost.

                    <li>
                        <span class="card-name">
                            <a>
                                Sunbaked Canyon:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">

                        </span>
                        paying 1 life each time you tap this is no small cost, specially with cards like Eidolon and Flame Rift in the mix. However, the upside is just too strong. A big weakness of ours is flooding out, and these lands are effectively cantrips unless drawn early. That is very powerful, and reducing the amount of lands that actually count towards flooding was a big step in keeping Burn a strong deck.

                        horizon lands are so good that 4 aren't enough, and including more is typically worth it, even if these ones only tap for R in our deck.

                <h2 class="subtitle">General Tips</h2>
                <p>To close out this page, I'll be going over some tips to help you get started with the deck.</p>

                <p>Goblin Guide on turn 1 is always better than Swiftspear, but on turn 2 and with a hand full of 1 mana spells, Monastery can represent more damage. Having both a Guide and a Swiftspear in hand on turn 2 shouldn't happen often, but it can when you are forced to kill a 1 drop on your first turn.</p>

                <p>Play at instant speed whenever you can, as to try and surprise opponents with a big burst of damage. 2 Boros Charm and 2 Bolts are 14 damage, and a player at 14 life will play a lot differently than one at 7. It also leaves open the possibility of interaction. Having 2 mana up with a fetchland threatens a Searing Blaze, and it might keep opponents on the defensive when all you have is a Boros Charm. On this same wave, bluffing sideboard cards can really mess up some opponents up. If you make your Hammer opponent think that you have a Deflecting Palm in hand, you might make them slow down enough that you steal a win from them.</p>

                <p>Avoid using Searing Blaze just because it has a target. I mentioned it earlier, but you really want to be using it on a creature you HAVE to kill. Having said that, don't risk missing landfall on it because of that. If you only have 1 land in hand on your turn 2, it's usually better to kill a subpar creature and keep the aggression on than it is to wait it out. On the other hand, it can also be worth it to not play your 2nd land on curve if you have a Searing Blaze in hand and are sure (like 100% absolutely sure) they are playing an annoying creature on their turn 2. Notably, this line is only worth it if you are in a matchup where you know you will be pressed for cards (usually because you want to be removing a lot of creatures), and needs to be well weighted before being executed.</p>

                <p>Also avoid killing any threat that isn't looking to be faster than you. For example, if your opponent plays a Stoneforge Mystic on turn 3 and fetches a Batterskull, you don't need to kill it if you can win instead. This one is very obvious, but I'm just trying to illustrate how killing a threat is not always the correct play.</p>

                <p>The order you play your lands in can be very intricate. If you have a Sacred Foundry in hand, I like leading on it on my turn 1. It makes playing at instant speed in the following turns much easier when you don't shamelessly pay 2 life for an untapped land and pass the turn. I usually try to play fetchlands after that, because of their deck thinning effect. It's not a reason to play them in a mono color deck (that doesn't care about cards in the graveyard), but it is a reason to play them earlier in the game. And finally, if I have Inspiring Vantage in hand, ensuring every land up till the 4th one comes in untapped is a priority.</p>

                <p>Eidolon of the Great Revel is best when it sticks around, but it can be particularly hard to do so against decks that play removal. If my Eidolon is better than a Goblin Guide in the matchup, you can try and trick your opponent to remove your Guide before you drop the Eidolon. You can do this by not playing your second land in your first main phase. That can remove Eidolon from your opponents mind and make tem kill the Guide, just for you to then drop the 2nd land and pseudo-lock them out of the game with the Eidolon. You can also do the opposite, which in my opinion is an even stronger play. Playing the 2nd land in the first main phase without an Eidolon in hand can make your opponent unsure if they should use their removal on Guide to save 2 life, or if they should save it to keep Eidolon from beating them on its own. That's a 2nd free hit from a Guide that would be dead otherwise, which is huge when it comes to value. NOTE: for these plays to work, you kinda have to go full poker player and sell your narrative. If you want to make them think you missed your 2nd land drop, try and look upsed when you draw your card for turn, and pretend to think for a bit before you go into combat. On the other hand, if you want to make them think you have the Eidolon, play that 2nd land and make a thinking pause before declaring attackers.</p>

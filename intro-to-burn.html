                <h1 class="page-title">Intro to Burn</h1>
                <p>If you're looking to get started with Burn in Modern, then this is the page for you! Hopefully, this is enough to get you started.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">"Isn't Burn just an easy intro deck?"</h2>
                <p>Short answer: no. One of the biggest misconceptions of this deck is that it's super easy to play, and that it's a good choice to lend to your friend that's new to the game. This simply isn't true. While Burn has quite a simple plan, a very linear one to boot, give it to someone that's still not sure about what the difference between Instants and Sorceries is, and they're guaranteed to have a bad time. Modern just isn't a format for beginners. It's a cutthroat one where mistakes are weighed in tons, and Burn is a deck that wins by grams. One wrong decision in the many that the deck presents will lose you games.</p>
                <p>Having said that, general modern knowledge and a bit of understanding in what makes this deck tick goes a long way in making it a very quick pick up. Mastering it (something which I don't claim to have done) is another story, and requires you to be able to look at the game in a more mathematical way. But we'll talk about that some other time. This page will cover the basics, the "what makes the deck tick" I mentioned earlier.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">What is Burn all about?</h2>
                <p>Burn is all about direct damage. The name "Burn" comes exactly from that effect, i.e., cards that can directly damage opponents. Effectively, variations of <span class="card-name"><a>Lightning Bolt</a></span>
                <span class="card-image-span"><img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-bolt.jpg"/></span>. </p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">What cards does Burn play?</h2>
                <p>In this section I'm gonna go over the mainboard cards that Burn plays, at least the core, established ones. Alternative or more "avant-garde" will be covered somewhere else.</p>

                                Goblin Guide:
                            </a>
                        </span>
                        <span class="card-image-span">
                            <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/goblin-guide.jpg"/>
                        </span>
                        the best creature in our deck. Some people underestimate it because they read it and think it'll draw their opponents a ton of cards, including helping them curve out their mana. But that's not how the card works. Because Goblin Guide draws lands on reveal, a land which they would've drawn either way, it actually helps your opponents find non-land spells. That means that, barring a deck with an unusually high number of lands, it will just give you info about your opponents hand around 66% percent of the time. That's a pretty good deal, when you add to it that Burn results in fast games, where 1 or 2 extra cards are unlikely to affect the game. Because of this, I don't read Goblin Guide as a liability, but as a strength. I don't think that I then have to explain why a hasty 2/2 for R is a good card to be playing, but I will anyway. It comes out swinging, and 2 damage per turn add up quick. It puts us in a position where our opponents need to answer it soon, or we just get too much damage for that one Red mana and become veeeery unlikely to lose.

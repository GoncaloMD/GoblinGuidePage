                <p>If I were lazy (which, full disclosure, I am, but I'll try not to be when it comes to writing this guide), I'd slap whatever decklist I'm currently playing on MTGO, and then just tell you which cards I side in and out in each popular matchup. But that doesn't really work, for a couple of reasons. First of all, without understanding why cards are coming in, you won't really use them to their full extent. At the very least, I need to explain you why I'm bringing in certain cards for certain matchups (even if some choices are pretty straight forward). Then, you might also not be on my exact list. Your local meta might be different from what you see in MTGO (which is very likely given how inbred the MTGO meta can be), or you might just have some personal preference in cards (which I fully support, don't let me dissuade you from playing the cards you like. Except for Kor Firewalker, don't play that garbadge card). So I'm left with what some would call a "pickle", which is to build a sideboard guide that is adaptable to different lists, all while explained with some detail why cards are being swapped for games 2 and 3. This guide is my attempt at doing that, but do note that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I could be wrong on things, and I'll update this guide whenever I realise that, and</li>
                    <li>You can disagree with what I say here, and that is totally fine, because I'm not some asshole that thinks everyone else is wrong about things (again, except regarding Kor Firewalker, because that card is total garbadge).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hopefully, even if your list diverges from the one I present here, you can still apply all or some of the knowledge in this guide to your games.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Fixed Slots</h3>
                <p>First things first, let me show you what cards I consider "fixed slots" in Burn. These are the cards that you should always be playing a playset of in any reasonable meta.</p>

                <h3>Flexible Slots</h3>
                <p>Now come the so called "flex slots" of the deck. These are cards that are good enough to be played in the mainboard, but not in every meta, since they have a more specific use than just being very efficient at dealing damage. Because of this, I'd never really play more than 3. All of these can also slot into the sideboard if needed, so keep that in mind when looking at matchup ins & outs further down in this guide.</p>

                <h3>Mana base</h3>
                <p>For completeness, I'll also include what are, in my opinion, the lands you should be playing in the deck. 20 is the correct number for lands, as it gives you the best chance of having an ideal opening hand (spell/land ratio-wise). I'll leave 3-color mana for some other time too, so if you're curious about that, either hold on a bit or ask me about it.</p>

                <h2>Building the Sideboard</h2>
                <p>Before jumping into the actual matchups, I want to share my heuristic (which is just a fancy word for "personal baseline") for building my Burn sideboard: the 3x5 rule. It's maybe ironic that a deck built around Lightning Bolt also has this configuration for the sideboard, but I truly believe that if you're playing Burn, your sideboard should only have 1 of 2 configurations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You play 5 different cards in your sideboard, all at 3 copies</li>
                    <li>ou play 4 different cards in your sideboard, all at at least 3 copies, with the remaining slots being 4th copies of the most important cards</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The reason I don't include "cheeky" singles, or even only 2 copies of cards (with different purposes), is because in Burn you aren't drawing cards (outside of cracking Sunbaked Canyon to try and reach that last Bolt that'll win you the game). As such, less than 3 copies makes it so those cards are mathematically unlikely to impact games. Sure, our plan A is very strong and always works even if you don't draw your sideboard cards, but if I'm putting cards in, it's because I want to draw them to increase my chances of winning, or else I wouldn't be siding them in at all.</p>

                <p>But which 4/5 cards do you choose? That's the hard part, really. You need to pick things that are actually relevant for the meta you're playing in. I've tried to simplify this choice by separating available choices into packages (i.e., groups of cards that have the same purpose, but work a bit differently from each other). You can mix cards inside the same package, but each package should follow the previous suggestion of only occupying 3 or 4 slots in the sideboard.</p>

                <p>(NOTE: the following list of cards might not be complete. I could've forgotten something, or I could think a specific card isn't even worth mentioning, but if you think I did forget something, do message me. I'll either thank you and add it, or tell you why I don't think the card deserves the spotlight)</p>

                <h3>Graveyard package</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you can't handle how much value your opponents get from their graveyard. Be it a super unfair deck like Dredge trying to smuggle cards onto the battlefield through the graveyard, or a slower deck incrementally gaining advantage from it, their speed and/or their grinding capabilities are just too much for you to handle. To combat this, you play cards that exile the opponents graveyard, and the cards that I think are worthy of being included are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sanctifier en-Vec: it's a permanent form of graveyard hate that's not only hard to kill, but can also get in for some damage, meaning extra copies aren't "dead" cards. Having some extra creatures in the side is also a great way of screwing those Leyline of Sanctity degenerates. Aside from all that, this card even has some other applications against non-graveyard centric decks. For example, protection from BR means that this card can also be brought in to spank Prowess and Shadow decks.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Rest in Peace: it's amazing that this card and the previous one miss most of each other's matchups. As such, I don't believe that you should exclusively choose one or the other, but instead, think about if you need them individually, and if you do, just play both. 6 slots in the side is heavy, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Tormod's Crypt: being a single use option makes this card not as attractive against those slower, grindier graveyard decks, but don't underrate the ability of casting your hate on turn 1. Both Rest in Peace and Sanctifier en-Vec, although absolutely crushing when they come down, can do it far too late. Some of the most explosive graveyard decks can nut all over you before your second land is down, so a faster option can be played if you're mostly worried about fast graveyard decks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Anti-lifegain package</h3>
                <p>The bane of this deck (but not really), lifegain, is how a lot of decks used to prepare to play against aggro decks. In recent times, however, aggro has evolved to have its damage come from permanent sources, meaning lifegain has become a pretty bad way to stop it. It still works great against Burn, but that's about it. However, it's something people still like doing. You'll often see players casting Blossoming Calm, lose on the crackback to a very unfavourable board, and then complain about it. Luckily, we have some pretty good tools to combat this, which are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Roiling Vortex: the best card I never even wished for, it offers something unique. Althought it's still a bit short of being its more abusive older brother, Roling Vortex offers consistent damage as part of our plan A. It's a hate card you get to play proactively, and puts pressure on the other side just by being there. The one mana it asks you to leave open to actually fulfill its purpose is, more often than not, easy to hold, meaning you still get to be aggressive in your sequencing. It's also typically hard to deal with, what with being an enchantment and all, which means sticking one for the entire game isn't that hard. It even has a relevant line of text against free spells, which are more common than ever right now, and will commonly surprise illiterate opponents. Just make sure to remember that it also hits your own suspended Rift Bolts.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Skullcrack: it used to be a fixed slot in the mainboard before they gave us Skewer the Critics, but has fluctuaded in use ever since. At first, it looks like it's the best choice for the job, because at worst it's a 2 mana Lava Spike, and how bad could that be? Well, apparently, bad enough to relegate it to being the 2nd choice when it comes to anti-lifegain in the sideboard. Let me explain why I think this. Skullcrack is a reactive hate card, meaning you really want to cast it in 2 situations: if you're using it to stop lifegain, or if you're using it to win the game. The issue then comes when you have to hold up mana to be able to cast this card at a moment's notice, mana which you can't use to cast all the sorceries the deck runs, and end up slowing yourself down. As such, in cases where the anti-damage-prevention clause isn't relevant (basically, if you know someone who is stuck in 2015 and still playing Kor Firewalker, in 2020 and still playing Auriok Champion, or god forbid, in 1985 and still playing Burrengton Forge-Tender), Skullcrack just doesn't cut it as the main anti-lifegain card.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Removal package</h3>
                <p>Although our deck has 20+ removal cards in the mainboard, sometimes things just don't die to Lightning Bolt. Be it those pesky 4 toughness Dryads, those thick, thick Murktides, or those annoying creatures with Protection from Red, if you want to kill them, you need something else that isn't dealing 3 damage. This slot will variy depending on what you want to be killing most often, since nowadays there are options for all sorts of problem cards, which are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Path to Exile: the most common choice, since it hits everything you'd ever want dead (this does include birds, but you have to do it on their upkeep, and it kinda only stops it for a turn, since you're effectively just turning said bird into a tapped land). The downside on this card has become relevant for Control and Midrange decks in recent times, but for us, whose plan A is run over opponents with fast damage, ramping them isn't relevant in the big majority of games.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Prismatic Ending: a newer option, but one that can't quite hit some key targets. It can freely hit dorks, including Utopia Sprawl, which can be very relevant in the right meta. It's a card you wouldn't really play if your LGS is plagued with Wurmcoil Engines, Stormwing Entities and Murktide Regents, but if your biggest worries are Shadows, Auriok Champions, and any form of birdoid creatures, then there's an argument to play this. It notably hits Humans quite well, since it hits Aether Vial, Chalice of the Void (yes, they have been playing it in the side, and it's super annoying) and even Thalia without having to pay any extra mana (Thalia's ability makes you pay one extra mana to even cast the card, so if you choose X=0 and pay the Thalia tax with red mana, Prismatic Ending gets to exile cards of MV 2).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Unholy Heat: the obvious downside of this one is that it doesn't solve Protection from Red creatures, so you'd obviously only even consider this if you don't have any of those lurking around. Although Burn might not look like the easiest deck to achieve delirium with, it's actually not hard to do, seeing as your creature openers are either dealt with or they flat out win you the game. From there, you then have the best R (strict) removal spell in the game. Even without delirium, having extra turn 1 removal is quite valuable against a lot of the turn 1 plays that exist in the format.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Searing Blood: technically it doesn't solve anything that a Bolt doesn't (it actually solves less, because 3 > 2, if you can believe it), but I feel like it should be included here just because it is a card that has its worth. If the creatures you most often need to kill die to this card, it's definitely the best one to have, since it then becomes equivalent of drawing a Bolt and a Shock on a single card, and that's exactly the type of card advantage that Burn wants in a creature riddled meta.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Artifact/Enchantment hate package</h3>
                <p>you can't really Bolt any of these, and some of them are a real beating. That means that you need answers for them, even if they end up diverging from your plan A. There's a bunch of options, but here I'll limit myself to the ones I find worthy of including, which follow:</p>
                <ul>
                    Smash to Smithereens: if you aren't worried about any Enchantments (which you should rarely be), there's nothing better than this. It's simply a Bolt attached to a Shatter, can't get more efficient than that. It is a bit narrow, so it might range from awkward to downright wrong to bring in, but in the matchups where you really need it, it just shines.
                </ul>

                <h3>ETB hate package</h3>
                <p>Burn has always had this weakness to ETB's because it can't really interact with them in any relevant way. Some very niche, yet powerful creatures being printed has helped solving this problem. The secret value of these creatures isn't their static ability, but the fact that they have evasion and get to hit your opponents for some damage, making them proactive enough to justify them. There are only 2, which are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strict Proctor: it single handedly makes the Amulet Titan matchups go from "holy shit how can I even" to "ah, gotcha". That's valuable enough as is, but on top of that, this card also improves the very poor tribal matchups that Burn has, more specifically, Humans, Taxes and Spirits, as well as hitting Stoneforge Mystic decks quite well (it makes them need 2 extra mana to pay for Living Weapon).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Hushbringer: quite similar to the previous choice, but with flipped use. Completely crushes those creature ETB tribal decks, since they essentially stop functioning, but has a weaker impact against Amulet Titan, since it's only nullifying their first Titan search.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other options</h3>
                <p>Some hate cards are too miscellaneous to classify, being flex slots to hate on very specific things, but they have their worth, and are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Deflecting Palm: an old favourite of mine, but ever since Amulet Titan stopped winning through combat damage, it's just too niche for my taste. Still a great option to include if your meta has a lot of Hammer decks, since they pretty much can't ever beat you if you have Deflecting Palm ready, but aside from that, I wouldn't consider it.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Kor Firewalker: probably my least favourite card in this list, not because it's bad, but because it's essentially a waste of a sideboard slot. It only really comes in against Rx Prowess, which is one of the easiest matchups for us, and you really shouldn't be wasting slots on such a free matchup, and against the Burn mirror, which accounts for 1% of the meta on its best days, so not really a deck you should be spending slots for. Yet, a lot of Burn players love pushing this card onto their lists, including good Burn pilots, which makes it a popular choice, dispite it being objectively wrong (and this is one of the few things I'll state as fact). Having said that, if your local meta has an unusual high number of Burn, or even Prowess players, you can choose to sleeve up this card in order to relieve the stress of playing those matchups (even though it's not an auto win, because both decks are naturally ready to kill Protection from Red creatures).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Obsidian Charmaw: I'm not really a fan of playing land hate in Burn, because there really aren't any lands that you want to kill. Most annoying lands get to do their thing before you ever get a chance to destroy them (bounce lands, Eldrazi Temple, Radiant Fountain). Obsidian Charmaw is the only card that would ever make the cut, because it does offer something that your other spells don't: a big, cheap (you would only ever side it in against decks where it costs 2/3 mana to cast), disruptive, evasive body. So if your meta has a lot of Eldrazi Tron, then there might be an argument to play this.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>These cards should about cover everything you could ever need in your sideboard. If there are too many requests to add something else, and its not something that I intentionally omitted, I can add it, but I'll likely not make many positive comments on it.</p>

                <p>I typically build my sideboard with a Graveyard hate package, an Anti-lifegain package, a Removal package, and an Artifact hate package. Then the last 3 slots are toss ups. If there isn't any deck that's particularly worrying, I simply include 4th copies of the cards I already have, to further enhance my ability to draw those cards in post board games.</p>

                <h1>Matchups</h1>
                <p>How to interpret the following section: I'm going to talk about each matchup, and then give you a list of cards to cut and to bring in. You'll likely end up with a number of cards different than 60, so what you do is you make cuts/adds according to the smallest number of carda you have, i.e., you count the number of ins you have, and the number of outs you have. Whichever is the lowest, you do that one first, and then do the other one (in order) until you have 60 cards.</p>

                These are cards that you should be playing a playset of, no matter what. You'll notice that some very signature cards are missing, and that's because I truly believe that they are all cuttable under specific metagames.

                    </span>
                    <span>The best card of our deck, without a doubt. Such simple, elegant design, straight from the first set of magic, yet easily the most balanced and, in my opinion, most interesting cards out there. It is an answer for early game threats, and although it doesn't scale well with the game, it always has a target. The flexibility of this card (and others like it) are what really push Burn to be what I'd say is one of the most versatile decks out there.</span>

                    </span>
                    <span>None of the flexibility of Lightning Bolt, which makes it much worse. So much that while the former is a format staple that essentially plays every deck that can generate red mana. On the other hand, Lava Spike is pretty much only playable by us, because Burn is a critical mass deck that just wants as much of this effect as possible.</span>

                    </span>
                    <span>This spell, in my opinion, is stronger than Rift Bolt. That's because Skewer the Critics, although it needs support to be cast for 1 mana, is much less prone to being awkward than Rift Bolt. As such, I consider it the one of the two that you should never cut.</span>
                </p>

                    <span>Both this and Skewer the Critics are awkward in some scenarios, but only Rift Bolt can't win you the game when you just needs to draw a 3 damage spell for your last living turn.

                    <span>Easily the greatest creature for Burn. It can push a lot of damage for very low investment, often being 4 and 6 damage for 1 mana. Now, you might read the card and say "but hey, this card is drawing my opponent lands, isn't that bad?". Abso-fucking-lutely not. Well, kinda. The fact is that this card doesn't help your opponent draw lands. Your opponent would always draw the lands that Goblin Guide reveals, so it's fallacious to think that your Goblin Guide is helping your opponent with lands. What Goblin Guide does, however, is it helps your opponents to reach their non-lands faster. That is the true downside of Goblin Guide. But this only happens about 1/3 of the time. The other 2/3's are actually an upside. Seeing the top card of your opponents library can be very powerful. Seeing a removal spell or a counter can help you sequence your spells better.</span>

This card introduces a need for sequence, which means that it's much less powerful if you aren't playing to its strengths.

Well, not as flexible as, but still, a huge source of virtual card advantage (i.e., even though it doesn't deal as much damage per mana spent as other spells, it does the most damage from a single spell, which is very relevant considering you only draw so many cards per game). Being an instant and essentially no downside means it really is the pillar 2 mana value spell of the deck.</span>

                    <span>For quite a long time, this card was an uncontested fixed slot. However, in recent times, boards have become harder to break through, and removal has become much more widespread to deal with some powerful decks. As such, Eidolon of the Great Revel has both a harder time sticking around and hitting opponents to break the parity of its effect.

                    </span>
                    <span>Incredible source of card advantage, since it is equivalent as using two Lightning Bolt effects. But although its ceiling is high, it can be a dead card in some matchups. Having a land to use it to its full potential can also be hard to guarantee at times. For these reasons, it is hard to justify carrtying more than 3 of these.</span>

                    <span>A necessary evil for when lifegain and/or protection from Red are popular. This used to be a clear sideboard card, but they keep attaching random lifegain to cards, so it morphed into a mainboard card, using some of the flex slots. I think it could be cut from the mainboard in some metagames, but it's not advised to ever not pack at least 3 in your whole deck.</span>

                <h2>Sideboard Slots</h2>
                Personally, I like using my sideboard slots to improve bad matchups. That doesn't mean I dedicate too many slots to beating impossible to fix matchups, it just means that I try to edge those harder matchups. This means that commonly favoured matchups, like Prowess and Shadow, are not really taken into account when preparing sideboards. They are favourable enough, even through some hate pieces, and unless I'm heading into a particular tournament where those decks have an unusual high meta share, I won't be making sideboard decisions based on those.

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Path to Exile:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/path-to-exile.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>Another very good reason to be playing White. This card deals with everything that a Lightning Bolt can't, and allows us to maintain a favourable board for a bit longer. It also kills creatures with Protection from Red, which can be a real pain to deal with otherwise. The downside of Path to Exile has become more noticeable with the addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den to the format, but for us, whose plan A is to end the game as fast as possible, that downside will regularly be irrelevant for the outcome of the game. For that reason, it is the preffered removal coming out of the sideboard.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Roiling Vortex:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/roiling-vortex.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>One of your strongest tools against any deck that wants to either drag out the game, or slowly gain life over a couple of turns. It also hits free spells, but that's mostly a bonus, since by nature, most free spells in the format either come down before it (Mishra's Bauble, Ornithopter), or can be used to take care of it (Force of Negation). Making those spells dead draws after its down is a nice upside, but not a reason to play this. The real reason to play this is the inevitable clock it presents, alongside denying your opponent's ability to try outpace you with lifegain.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Smash to Smithereens:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/smash-to-smithereens.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>The absolute strongest card to deal with Artifacts. Having 3 damage attached to it means that drawing this against artifact decks is equal to drawing both a Lava spike and a Shatter effect. A 2-for-1 is rarely the wrong play, typically being enough to turn around games. This does get awkward against decks that don't have too many targets, but do have artifacts that you cannot beat, like Chalice of the Void or Batterskull, so it can be awkward to have it instead of a more flexible card.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Rip Apart:
                        </a>

                    </span>
                    <span>This is pretty much the most flexible card you could ever have in your sideboard. It deals with just about anything, notably including enchantments, which are the hardest type of permanent for us to beat. Not because there isn't enough hate for it, but because they still haven't printed a card that deals damage upon destroying enchantments, making including specific enchantment hate hard to justify in most metas. This card changed that, in the sense that this is a very strong card against quite a few decks, and then has the flexibility of also killing enchantments.</span>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>

                    </span>
                    <span>Easily on of the best graveyard hate cards around, it can completely blow away some decks if they aren't prepared to deal with it. Even if this is a reactive card, it can earn space in your sideboard if graveyard strategies are particularly prevalent. One deck I don't enjoy this card against is Dredge, where it can either be too slow, or destroyed with tempo advantage, because Dredge players never not bring in their anti-hate cards. Having said that, it's definitely the card to have to deal with graveyards if they are a problem.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Sanctifier en-Vec:
                        </a>

                    </span>
                    <span>Very similar to Rest in Peace, with the slight difference that its ability doesn't work for permanents that leave the battlefield, this card is an absolute banger against both graveyard and non-graveyard Red/Black decks. It's hard to deal with, comes down early, and even attacks. It's everything you'd want in your graveyard hate slot. The only situation where you shouldn't run this over Rest in Peace is when graveyard decks relying on White/Blue/Green are popular. There aren't that many, but there are some, like for example, post MH2 Living End.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Surgical Extraction:
                        </a>

                    </span>
                    <span>A favourite of mine, but much more niche. This card is definitely the one to run if every graveyard deck running around relies on a single piece to beat you. This can happen because Burn can afford to not care about some cards in graveyards. For example, back when Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath was a popular card, I was playing surgical to take care of it without losing any tempo.</span>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Strict Proctor:
                        </a>
                    </span>

                    </span>
                    <span>One of my favourite cards to run in sideboards, it covers Burn's holes very well. Burn historically has trouble with dealing with ETB based decks (Humans, Spirits, Taxes) and also Amulet Titan. This card hits all of those really well, making them much more even if it hits the battlefield.</span>

                <h2>Sideboarding</h2>
                Now I'll attempt to give suggestions on each matchup, and which card to cut and which cards to bring in. Because I want this guide to not be specific to any list I'm running, I'll just list inclusions from most important to least important, and cuts in the same way.

                <h3>UWx Control</h3>
                This matchup can feel very hard if you don't know how to navigate it. The secret is a 3 step plan:
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with aggression. This means opening the game with permanent threats and using your cheap spells while your opponent can't answer everything you do.</li>
                    <li>Start simply holding spells when your opponent starts going up in mana, so when he starts going through your turn with 3-4 ununsed mana.</li>
                    <li>Unload your hand on his end step and your own step in a 1-2 punch way, to try and burst down his remaining health through any counters he can cast.</li>
                </ol>
                It can still be rough to get used to the match, specially when a single wrong move can cost you the game, but unless they are playing some weird, salty anti-red tech, the matchup should be slightly favoured.

                <p>Writing a sideboard guide isn't simple. Not only do I need to be on top of the current meta with it, but it also gets awkward when people consulting it have different prefences than me. Which is fine. Modern is far from being solved. When you see someone claiming their list is the superior one and/or "busted", they're 100% baiting you, or just don't understand the game. Usually a mix of both. But I won't attempt to give you a list of 75 cards, claiming they are the best ones to be running, and have a simple "ins n' outs" for each matchup. I will instead present here a list of the most common mainboard cards, a list of interesting sideboard cards, and then list priority cuts and adds for each matchup.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Mainboard</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Fixed Slots</h3>
                These are cards that you should be playing a playset of, no matter what. You'll notice that some very signature cards are missing, and that's because I truly believe that they are all cuttable under specific metagames.
                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Lightning Bolt:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-bolt.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>The best card of our deck, without a doubt. Such simple, elegant design, straight from the first set of magic, yet easily the most balanced and, in my opinion, most interesting cards out there. It is an answer for early game threats, and although it doesn't scale well with the game, it always has a target. The flexibility of this card (and others like it) are what really push Burn to be what I'd say is one of the most versatile decks out there.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Lava Spike:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lava-spike.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>None of the flexibility of Lightning Bolt, which makes it much worse. So much that while the former is a format staple that essentially plays every deck that can generate red mana. On the other hand, Lava Spike is pretty much only playable by us, because Burn is a critical mass deck that just wants as much of this effect as possible.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Skewer the Critics:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/skewer-the-critics.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>This spell, in my opinion, is stronger than Rift Bolt. That's because Skewer the Critics, although it needs support to be cast for 1 mana, is much less prone to being awkward than Rift Bolt. As such, I consider it the one of the two that you should never cut.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Rift Bolt:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/rift-bolt.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>Both this and Skewer the Critics are awkward in some scenarios, but only Rift Bolt can't win you the game when you just needs to draw a 3 damage spell for your last living turn. For that reason, I consider 1 Rift Bolt to be cuttable if you need to slot in some extra flex slots.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Goblin Guide:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/goblin-guide.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>Easily the greatest creature for Burn. It can push a lot of damage for very low investment, often being 4 and 6 damage for 1 mana. Now, you might read the card and say "but hey, this card is drawing my opponent lands, isn't that bad?". Abso-fucking-lutely not. Well, kinda. The fact is that this card doesn't help your opponent draw lands. Your opponent would always draw the lands that Goblin Guide reveals, so it's fallacious to think that your Goblin Guide is helping your opponent with lands. What Goblin Guide does, however, is it helps your opponents to reach their non-lands faster. That is the true downside of Goblin Guide. But this only happens about 1/3 of the time. The other 2/3's are actually an upside. Seeing the top card of your opponents library can be very powerful. Seeing a removal spell or a counter can help you sequence your spells better.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Monastery Swiftspear:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>I would play 8 Goblin Guide before the first Monastery Swiftspear, but since that is not legal, she fills the slot just fine. This card introduces a need for sequence, which means that it's much less powerful if you aren't playing to its strengths. Having said that, the upside of being able to match, or, in very rare cases, even surpass the damage output of Goblin Guide is strong enough that I'm never really dissapointed with the card.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Boros Charm:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/boros-charm.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>The reason you should be playing White in your Burn deck. This card may not seem like much, but drawing this is essentially drawing 2 Shocks. Well, not as flexible as, but still, a huge source of virtual card advantage (i.e., even though it doesn't deal as much damage per mana spent as other spells, it does the most damage from a single spell, which is very relevant considering you only draw so many cards per game). Being an instant and essentially no downside means it really is the pillar 2 mana value spell of the deck.</span>
                </p>

                <h3>Flexible Slots</h3>
                These are cards that fill out the remaining slots of the mainboard. They can go anywhere from 4 copies to 0 copies, depending on what the current/local metagame is.

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Eidolon of the Great Revel:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/eidolon-of-the-great-revel.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>For quite a long time, this card was an uncontested fixed slot. However, in recent times, boards have become harder to break through, and removal has become much more widespread to deal with some powerful decks. As such, Eidolon of the Great Revel has both a harder time sticking around and hitting opponents to break the parity of its effect. That plus decks like Amulet Titan becoming a format pillar means that leaving Eidolon in the binder can be the correct call for some metagames.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Lightning Helix:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-helix.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>It is weird that a Lightning Strike stapled to a Healing Salve is so good, but god is this one of the best flex cards for this deck. Lifegain is typically a shit text line, but when you staple it to a flexible spell such as Lightning Strike, it becomes an amazing tool for us to be able to win races without too much issue. Specially considering there are some self damage spells on our list, as well as having a mana base that does cause some pain.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Flame Rift:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/flame-rift.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>The newest addition to the deck, but it's quite a strong one. Boros Charm is the reason to play White in the deck, and Flame Rift does a good job at being additional copies of that spell. Obviously it being symmetrical has its downsides, so this card should always be paired with a good number of Lightning Helix.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Searing Blaze:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/searing-blaze.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>Incredible source of card advantage, since it is equivalent as using two Lightning Bolt effects. But although its ceiling is high, it can be a dead card in some matchups. Having a land to use it to its full potential can also be hard to guarantee at times. For these reasons, it is hard to justify carrtying more than 3 of these.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Skullcrack:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/skullcrack.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>A necessary evil for when lifegain and/or protection from Red are popular. This used to be a clear sideboard card, but they keep attaching random lifegain to cards, so it morphed into a mainboard card, using some of the flex slots. I think it could be cut from the mainboard in some metagames, but it's not advised to ever not pack at least 3 in your whole deck.</span>
                </p>

                <h2>Sideboard Slots</h2>
                Personally, I like using my sideboard slots to improve bad matchups. That doesn't mean I dedicate too many slots to beating impossible to fix matchups, it just means that I try to edge those harder matchups. This means that commonly favoured matchups, like Prowess and Shadow, are not really taken into account when preparing sideboards. They are favourable enough, even through some hate pieces, and unless I'm heading into a particular tournament where those decks have an unusual high meta share, I won't be making sideboard decisions based on those.

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Path to Exile:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/path-to-exile.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>Another very good reason to be playing White. This card deals with everything that a Lightning Bolt can't, and allows us to maintain a favourable board for a bit longer. It also kills creatures with Protection from Red, which can be a real pain to deal with otherwise. The downside of Path to Exile has become more noticeable with the addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den to the format, but for us, whose plan A is to end the game as fast as possible, that downside will regularly be irrelevant for the outcome of the game. For that reason, it is the preffered removal coming out of the sideboard.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Roiling Vortex:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">
                        <img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/roiling-vortex.jpg"/>
                    </span>
                    <span>One of your strongest tools against any deck that wants to either drag out the game, or slowly gain life over a couple of turns. It also hits free spells, but that's mostly a bonus, since by nature, most free spells in the format either come down before it (Mishra's Bauble, Ornithopter), or can be used to take care of it (Force of Negation). Making those spells dead draws after its down is a nice upside, but not a reason to play this. The real reason to play this is the inevitable clock it presents, alongside denying your opponent's ability to try outpace you with lifegain.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Smash to Smithereens:
                        </a>
                    </span>
                    <span class="card-image-span">

                    </span>
                    <span>The absolute strongest card to deal with Artifacts. Having 3 damage attached to it means that drawing this against artifact decks is equal to drawing both a Lava spike and a Shatter effect. A 2-for-1 is rarely the wrong play, typically being enough to turn around games. This does get awkward against decks that don't have too many targets, but do have artifacts that you cannot beat, like Chalice of the Void or Batterskull, so it can be awkward to have it instead of a more flexible card.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="card-name">

                    </span>
                    <span>This is pretty much the most flexible card you could ever have in your sideboard. It deals with just about anything, notably including enchantments, which are the hardest type of permanent for us to beat. Not because there isn't enough hate for it, but because they still haven't printed a card that deals damage upon destroying enchantments, making including specific enchantment hate hard to justify in most metas. This card changed that, in the sense that this is a very strong card against quite a few decks, and then has the flexibility of also killing enchantments.</span>

                    </span>
                    <span>Easily on of the best graveyard hate cards around, it can completely blow away some decks if they aren't prepared to deal with it. Even if this is a reactive card, it can earn space in your sideboard if graveyard strategies are particularly prevalent. One deck I don't enjoy this card against is Dredge, where it can either be too slow, or destroyed with tempo advantage, because Dredge players never not bring in their anti-hate cards. Having said that, it's definitely the card to have to deal with graveyards if they are a problem.</span>

                    <span>Very similar to Rest in Peace, with the slight difference that its ability doesn't work for permanents that leave the battlefield, this card is an absolute banger against both graveyard and non-graveyard Red/Black decks. It's hard to deal with, comes down early, and even attacks. It's everything you'd want in your graveyard hate slot. The only situation where you shouldn't run this over Rest in Peace is when graveyard decks relying on White/Blue/Green are popular. There aren't that many, but there are some, like for example, post MH2 Living End.</span>

                            Surgical Extraction:

                    </span>
                    <span>A favourite of mine, but much more niche. This card is definitely the one to run if every graveyard deck running around relies on a single piece to beat you. This can happen because Burn can afford to not care about some cards in graveyards. For example, back when Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath was a popular card, I was playing surgical to take care of it without losing any tempo.</span>

                    <span class="card-name">
                        <a>
                            Strict Proctor:
                        </a>
                    </span>

                    </span>
                    <span>One of my favourite cards to run in sideboards, it covers Burn's holes very well. Burn historically has trouble with dealing with ETB based decks (Humans, Spirits, Taxes) and also Amulet Titan. This card hits all of those really well, making them much more even if it hits the battlefield.</span>

                <h2>Sideboarding</h2>
                Now I'll attempt to give suggestions on each matchup, and which card to cut and which cards to bring in. Because I want this guide to not be specific to any list I'm running, I'll just list inclusions from most important to least important, and cuts in the same way.

                <h3>UWx Control</h3>
                This matchup can feel very hard if you don't know how to navigate it. The secret is a 3 step plan:
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with aggression. This means opening the game with permanent threats and using your cheap spells while your opponent can't answer everything you do.</li>
                    <li>Start simply holding spells when your opponent starts going up in mana, so when he starts going through your turn with 3-4 ununsed mana.</li>
                    <li>Unload your hand on his end step and your own step in a 1-2 punch way, to try and burst down his remaining health through any counters he can cast.</li>
                </ol>
                It can still be rough to get used to the match, specially when a single wrong move can cost you the game, but unless they are playing some weird, salty anti-red tech, the matchup should be slightly favoured.

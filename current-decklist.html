                <p>I'm usually not a fan of the Burn lists that place in events, since most of them are carbon copies of previous lists, and that results in Burn being a deck that commonly takes a long ass time to adapt to the meta. Because of that, I prefer adapting my list more proactively to what goes on in modern. As such, I'm making this page to showcase what I'm playing around with. At least the list I think is best set to perform in the current meta, whatever that may be.</p>

                <p>So, here is my current list (courtesy of <a href="https://aetherhub.com/" target="_blank" class="social-link">aetherhub</a>):</p>
                <iframe 
                    src="https://aetherhub.com/Deck/Embedded/modern-burn-500626" 
                    width="400"
                    height="700"
                    frameborder="0">
                </iframe>

                <p>There are some notable differences from what would be considered the "stock" burn list, and I want to address those choices so that you don't think I'm just randomly removing cards from the deck for attention.</p>

				<p>

							Eidolon of the Great Revel:
						</a>
					</span>
					<span class="card-image-span">
						<img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/eidolon-of-the-great-revel.jpg"/>
					</span>
					I've been very vocal about cutting Eidolon over at the Burn Discord, but I'll try to quickly summarise this choice. There are three aspects of the current meta that make the card into a poor choice for Burn. The density of removal cards has substantially gone up. With decks having to deal with Ragavan and other busted cheap threats, Eidolon is faced with removal much more often. "Dies to removal" isn't a valid argument not to run a card, but to us this isn't that. It's "our card dealt 2 damage, and can push the number of spells we need to resolve by 1". It completely goes against our whole motto, so it absolutely is an argument in our very specific case (where we measure card quality by how much damage they are guaranteed to do, not by how much damage they could do if Jeffrey Bezos signed off on it). Adding to this, there are some very popular cards (Fury, Solitude, Boseiju, Prismatic Ending, and March of the Otherwordly Light) that can effectively deal with Eidolon without triggering any damage. That means the average damage Eidolon is doing is even less than the already crippling 2. And the cherry on top of this shit sunday is that because of the two previous reasons, the only creature focused decks just go too wide for us to realistically control the board and use said Eidolon to deal damage on the ground (which is a key aspect of Eidolon being as good as he has been in the past). For those reasons, I'm off of Eidolon, trying out spells that for sure deal damage in its now vacant slot.

					</span>

					</span>
					Urza's Saga is a very strong card, and although only Hammer plays it out of the top tier decks, a whole bunch of tier 2 decks were made viable thanks to it. And all of them play Shadowspear, because of course they do, the inclusion cost is negligible. There's also the nice upside of being able to negate an Omnath trigger, even if that matchup is pretty favourable regardless of number of Skullcrack. As such, I consider Skullcrack to be the most important flex slot right now. Well, as important as Searing Blaze, which is always insanely useful. But Skullcrack has the advantage of not being awkward in multiples, hence why I'm playing 4 right now.

							Searing Blaze:

					</span>
					<span class="card-image-span">
						<img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/searing-blaze.jpg"/>
					</span>
					this card is insanely useful, and the current meta has enough creatures that it always has a legal target. I say legal target because even though there are a bunch of creatures you can kill with it, that doesn't mean there are a lot of creatures you want to kill with it. And when you aren't killing a target you REALLY need to kill, Searing Blaze isn't card advantage. It's just a Lightning Strike with extra steps. The card also gets super awkward in multiples, because triggering landfall on command isn't something we get to do more than once per game.

					</span>
					horizon (or canopy) lands are the perfect fit for Burn. They make 4 land hands keepable and make flooding less of an issue. Without Eidolon, there's (maybe) space to play more of the Red ones instead of only Sunbaked Canyon. After some testing with all 4, I settled for 3. Sometimes it's a bit painful, but games where we aren't cracking them we are likely going very fast, so it's less likely it matters. On the other hand, in games where you do want to be cracking them, they'll feel nuts.

							Lightning Helix:
						</a>
					</span>
					<span class="card-image-span">
						<img class="card-image" src="mtg-images/lightning-helix.jpg"/>
					</span>
					a nice flexible spell that helps through all the self damage I've included in my list. But its biggest upside is definitely being an unconditinal instant burn spell, sometimes just holding this in case you have to remove something at instant speed is very strong.

							Flame Rift:
						</a>
					</span>
					<span class="card-image-span">

					</span>
					a spell dealing 4 damage instead of 3 is such a big deal that I think that playing more of these is just worth it. Remember, each spell that deals 4 pushes us to only need 6 spells resolved to win the game.

				<p>I'm not planning to go over the sideboard choices, since they are pretty well covered in this page's sideboard guide, but if I see the need for it or if enough people ask me about them, I'll just add it here.</p>
